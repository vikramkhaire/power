# date 16/09/2022 code works and gives exact same restults. output is kept in dir output_power/final ;--> ready to modify and change

# date 17/01/2023: for metal line identification----

1. Not all 253 QSOs are uses by me. I am using only 231. Remaining 22 are either not probing the redshift range of interest (i.e they should have Lyman-alpha forest between rest wavelength 1050-1180 Angstrom) or too short in the Lyman alpha forest range to use it. Shortness is decided after removing milky way metals and emission lines. I will list these QSOs in the google doc.

2. Out of these 231 only 190 QSOs are fitted with vpfit. I tried all but 41 QSOs failed to fit. There can be couple of reasons for such failure.  1. if vpfit does not find any absorption line which happens if the QSO has low S/N or the fit region is too short 2. somehow vpfit does not converge fitting things and there could be several reasons for that.


7C-113807.79+463840.00 is bad; less that 10 pixels that can be used

The wavelength range is chosen between 1050 to 1180 Angstrom rest frame

-------------------- MASK info
These are the masks I use:
5 intervening (IGM) metal lines (the ones that Surya will identify)
6 geo-coronal emission line (1301-1307.5 Angstroms)
7 MW metal lines (I have already masked them)
4 bad data
3 for spectral gaps
and 0 is the data that I will be using
